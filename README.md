## 🌟 About The Project

Swishlist was built to solve the problem of gift-giving. It allows users to create personalized wishlists and share them with friends and family. Whether it's for a birthday, wedding, or holiday, Swishlist makes it easy to see what people truly want.

Here's why Swishlist is great:
*   **Simplicity:** An easy-to-use interface for adding items, either from online stores or custom entries.
*   **Shareability:** Share your lists with a simple link. No sign-up is required for viewers.
*   **Collaboration:** Friends and family can mark items as "purchased" to avoid duplicate gifts, and this is hidden from the list owner!

## ✨ Features

- **Create Multiple Wishlists:** Organize your wishes for different events, or just keep track of items you're interested in.
- **Rich Item Details:** Add notes, quantities, and priorities for each item.
- **Shareable Links:** Links are easy to share and can be accessed without an account.
- **Gift Reservation:** Avoid duplicate presents without spoiling the surprise.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on desktop and mobile.
- **AI Suggestions:** Get item suggestions based on your interests and past wishlists.
- **PWA Support:** Use Swishlist as a Progressive Web App for convenient access and share target visibility.
